# Huawei Cloud services icons libraries for draw.io

🌐 **Language**: **English** | [Português](./README.pt.md)

[draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) is a free and open source cross-platform
graph drawing software developed in HTML5 and JavaScript. Its interface can be
used to create diagrams such as flowcharts, wireframes, UML diagrams,
organizational charts and network diagrams.

Using the provided library you can draw [Huawei Cloud](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/)
system architectures.

There are two library groups: **color** and **line**. The **color** group
contains the icons you see in the Console and in the product pages. The **line**
group contains the old icons (black and white) which are no longer being
maintained, but the service names will be updated in a best-effort basis.

3. Decompress the zip file you downloaded at step 1 in a folder of your choice
   (e.g. "D:\drawio_libs");
4. Install libraries on draw.io:
   - Open draw.io, click on "File" > "Open Library..." menu;
   - Select a XML file from **color** or **line** folder;
   - draw.io does not allow to select more than one file at once, so you need
     to repeat the process for each XML file inside each **color** and **line**
     folder.
